When grouped into bins, the average GoodFit rates are roughly 81.6% for ages 30–39, 81.4% for ages 40–49, 77.4% for ages 50–59, 79.6% for ages 60–69, and 100% for ages 70–79. Although the differences across age bins are less pronounced than those seen in some racial subgroups, this variability suggests that age may also influence model predictions and warrants further investigation.\n",
